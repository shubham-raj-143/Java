/*
 *  ArrayList Vs Array : 
 *  The array list class is an implementation of the list interface that allows us to create resizable arrays.
 * 			
 * In java, we need to declare the size of array before we can use it.Once the size of array is declared, its hard to change it.
 * 
 * To handle this issue, we can use the ArrayList class.The ArrayList class present in java.util package allows us to create
 * resizable arrays
 * 
 * Unlike arrays, array lists(objects of ArrayList class) can automatically adjust its capacity when we add or remove elements
 * from it. Hence the ArrayLists are known as dynamic arrays.

/*
 * ArrayList <type> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
 * 
 * <type>-----This is only called Generic which indicates the type of array.
 * Before Java5 there was no GEneric due to which we could have entered String , Integer or any type in same ArrayList.
 * Which may further lead to RunTime error while extracting some particular datatype values from it.So Generic checks type during
 * compile time and hence save us from Collapsing our application.Hence it is boon.
