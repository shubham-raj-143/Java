package DataStructures.LinkedList;
/*ArrayList has continuous memory distribution, whereas LinkedList elements can be anywhere stored in memory.
 * For traversing in Linked List we store reference of next memory location in current array. JAVA has no concept of address so we store reference..We just want head and we can traverse through LinkedList.
 * 
 * Advantages of LINKEDLIST::::
 * for Inserting and Deleting an element in middle of the list.

 */
/*   LINKED LIST is a linear datastructure where the elements are not stored in continuous memory locations, and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
 * The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. 
 * Each element is known as node.
 * Due to dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over arrays.
 * 
 * It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from head and follow through the link to reach a node we wish to access.
 * 
 */

/* To store the elements in a linked list we use doubly linked linked list which provides a linear data structure and also used to inherit an abstract class and implement list and dequeue interfaces. In JAVA, LinkeList class implements the list interface.
 * 
 * The linked list class also consists of various constructors and methods like other java collections.
