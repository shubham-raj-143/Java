/*
>>This is very powerful datastructure which many times helps to bring the alogorithm from linear time to the constant time.

>> The Set Interface of Java Collections Framework provides the features of mathematical sets in java.
  It extends the Collection interface.
  Unlike the List Interface, sets cannot contain duplicate elements.
  
>> In Order to use functionalities of the Set interface, we can use these classes:
		1> HashSet
		2> Linked HashSet
		3> EnumSet
		4> TreeSet
 	
 	
>> Methods Of Set:
		add(element)
		addAll(collection)
		remove(element)
		removeAll()
		retainAll() --> Returns collections which have common elements to the two collections(INTERSECTION)
		clear()
		size()
		contains()
		containsAll() --> To check a collection is present in another collection.
		isEmpty()
		toArray()
