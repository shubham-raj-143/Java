/*
 
>> In java Priority Queues are implemented using heap.
 
>> A Priority Queue is a special type of Queue in which each element is associated with a priority and is served according to its priority.
 If elements with same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.(InPlace)
 
>> In a queue, the first in first out(FIFO) is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority.
 The element with highest priority is removed first.

>> Where to use::: 
	1> When there are many elements in array and the question says to print out top 5 greatest element, then if we will sort then 
   print then it might take long time(nlog n) , So we make use of PQ.(nlog k)
   
   2> Given n LinkedLists, each of them are sorted. So, we have to merge them and make 1 LL, and the new LL must also be sorted
   		One method: Put all LL elements in one list and then sort them(n Log n)
   		Another Method: If we make use of PQ(n log k)
