/* Collection Interface : It is the root interface of collections framework hierarchy.
 * 						Java does not provide direct implementations of the collection interface but provides implementations of its
 * 						subinterfaces like Sets, List, and Queue.
 */

/* List Interface: In java, the list interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and access elements sequentially
 * 					It extends the collection interface.
 * 					Since list is an interface, we cannot create objects from it. In order to use functionalities of the list 
 * 					interface, we can use these classes:
 * 					
 * 					1>ArrayList   2>LinkedList   3>Vector   4>Stack
 * 					
 * 
 * Set Interface : The set interface of java framework provides the features of the mathematical set in java. It extends the collection
 * 					interface. Unlike the list interface, sets cannot contain duplicate elements.
 * 					
 * 					In order to use functionalities , we can use 3 classes:
 * 					1>HashSet  2>LinkedashSet  3>EnumSet   4>TreeSet
 * 
 * Queue Interface : The Queue interface of java framework provides the functionalities of Queue datastructure.It extends the
 * 					Collection interface
 * 					In order to use the functionalities of the queue, we use classes that implement it:
 * 					1>ArrayDequeue 2>LinkedList  3> PriorityQueue.
 * 
 * Map Interface : The map interface of java collections framework provides the functionality of the map data structure.
 * 					Since Map is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.
 * 					In order to use functionalities of Map interface, we can use 3 classes:
 * 					1>HashMap  2> EnumMap  3>LinkedHashMap 4> WeakHashMap  5> TreeMap
