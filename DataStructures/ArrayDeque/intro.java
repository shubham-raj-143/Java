package DataStructures.ArrayDeque;
/* >>An ArrayDeque( Array Double Ended Queue) is a special kind of a growable array that allows us to add or remove
 * an elements from both sides.
 * 
 * >>An arraydeque implementation can be used as a Stack(LastIn LatOut) or a Queue(First In First Out).
 * 
 * >>ArrayDeque are faster than Linked List and Stack Class[as stack class is made up of Vector class which is thread
 * safe, so it needs to acquire lock which makes it slow]
 * 
 * 
 * >>Operations:[1st one is method that return null or false , 2nd one will throw exception]::
 * 
 * 1>Insertion from head: offerFirst(e), addFirst(e)
 * 2>Removal from head: pollFirst(e), removeFirst(e)
 * 3>Retrieval from head: peekFirst(e), getFirst(e)
 * 
 * 4>Insertion from tail: offerLast(e), addLast(e)
 * 5>Removal from tail: pollLast(e), removeLast(e)
 * 6>Retrieval from tail: peekLast(e), getLast(e)
 */
/*
 * Besides these operations it also has operations that we used in stack(push(), pop(), peek())
 *  and queue(add(), remove(), peek())
