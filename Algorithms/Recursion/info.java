   RECURSION:
  -------------
  There are just 3 steps to solve a problem using Recursion:
  
  1>Base case: Think of the simplest possible input for this function
  
  2>Find the Relation : Think how the larger problem can be solved with the help of the solution of 
  	the smaller problem.
  	
  3>Generalize : Make a generalized function that solves the problem. Put this all together into a 
  	Mathematical function or a tree.
