/* If we define class as 'final' then we cannot make its children anymore or basically it 
 * cannot be extended
 * 
 * If we define method as final then we cannot Override them.
 * 
 * We can assign final keyword to variable classes and methods
 * 
 * 1> A final variable cannot be changed
 * 2> A final method cannot be overridden
 * 3> A final class cannot be extended

/*FINAL VARIABLE::
 * 1> A final variable can only be initialized once
 * 
 * 2> We must initialize a final variable within class(global variable)(local variable may  
 * 	  or may not be initialized, but better to initialize them also),otherwise compiler 
 * 	  will throw compile-time error.
 * 
 * 3> It is good practice to name final variable in all CAPS
 * 
 * 4> A final variable is called blank variable, if not initialized while declaration.
 * 
 * 5> In case of a reference final variable, internal state of the object pointed by that reference
 * variable can be changed.
